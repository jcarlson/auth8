# Things TODO

## Story I

The site's author would like to protect the CRUD interface for posts so that only he can create and update blog posts. The author should be able to sign in and sign out safely on a shared computer.

## Story II

The site's author would like links to edit/create posts right on the home page to make it easier to edit existing content. Only the site's author should see these links, and only when the author is signed in.

## Story III

Readers of the site would like to be notified when new posts are published. The site should allow readers to provide their email address and name to get started.

## Story IV

The site's author would like to support "private" blog posts that only registered readers can view. Registered users should be able to "sign in" and "sign out" using their email address and a password.

## Story V

Registered readers frequently forget their password, so the site's author would like to provide a way for readers to "reset" their password on their own without contacting the author.

## Story VI (extra credit)

The site's author would like to allow some of his best readers to contribute posts. The contributed posts must be edited and approved by the author before appearing on the home page.
